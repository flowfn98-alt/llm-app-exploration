# Mobile App Exploration

A pattern for systematically exploring any mobile app using an LLM agent with physical device access — producing a complete map of every screen, every interaction, and every user flow.

This is an idea file. Share it with your LLM agent and explore together. The specifics will depend on your app, your device, and your goals.

## The core idea

Most app research is manual. A person taps through an app, takes screenshots when something looks interesting, and writes notes afterward. This produces partial, biased coverage — you see what catches your eye, miss what doesn't, and have no way to know what you missed.

The idea here is different. An LLM agent connected to a phone can see the screen (screenshot), understand what's on it (UI dump), and interact with it (tap, type, scroll, navigate). This means the agent can treat the app as a **graph** — each screen is a node, each tappable element is an edge — and perform a depth-first search. Systematically. Every screen, every dropdown, every toggle, every scroll position. Nothing skipped, nothing assumed.

The output is not a set of scattered screenshots. It's a **route map** — a structured, complete catalog of every screen in the app, with evidence (screenshots) and context (descriptions). Like a wiki for the app's UI. Once you have this, user flows, competitive analysis, gap analysis, and UX audits become trivial — you're working from complete data instead of memory and impressions.

This works for any app. We've used it on crypto wallets, but the pattern applies equally to banking apps, e-commerce, social media, productivity tools — anything with a UI.

## Philosophy

Three phases. Strictly separated.

**Explore** without organizing. **Organize** without analyzing. **Analyze** only on complete data.

Exploring while analyzing means you see what you want to see. Organizing while analyzing means your structure bends toward your conclusion. Analysis on incomplete data means confident but wrong. Do them in order. Each phase has its own output.

## Architecture

Four layers:

**Screenshots** — the raw evidence. Numbered PNGs captured during exploration. Immutable. Ground truth.

**ROUTES.md** — the route map. A flat table mapping every screenshot to its screen name, key elements, and one-line description. Plus a checklist of explored vs. unexplored areas, and a notes section for context (app version, device quirks, test account credentials, app state). The index, the log, and the status tracker in one file.

**TRANSITIONS.md** — the transition table. Maps `screen + action → next screen`. Built naturally during exploration — every action's response shows the new screen. Once complete, entire multi-screen flows become fully deterministic and batchable without intermediate UI dumps.

**User flows** — organized paths through the route map. "A user wants to complete a purchase" becomes a sequence of screenshots with step numbers, actions, and tap counts. Created after exploration is complete, by reading ROUTES.md and TRANSITIONS.md.

All four are built by the agent. You direct; the agent does the work.

## Operations

**Capture.** At each screen: read the UI elements, take a screenshot, record what you see. One row in ROUTES.md per screenshot. Number sequentially. Name descriptively. Move on.

**Navigate.** Treat the app as a graph. DFS: for each tappable element on the current screen, tap it. If it's a new screen, record the transition and recurse. If it's a modal or bottom sheet, capture and dismiss. Press BACK to return. When all elements are explored, the node is done. Maintain a checklist — mark what's explored, note what isn't.

**Record transitions.** Every action that changes the screen is a transition. The response from `mobile_do` always shows the new screen — log it as `screen + action → next screen` in TRANSITIONS.md.

**Document.** After exploration, read ROUTES.md and TRANSITIONS.md end to end. Group screenshots into user flows by task. One flow = one user goal.

### Depth

Not every exploration needs the same depth. Decide upfront.

**L1 — Screens.** Visit every screen, capture it. You get a complete screen map.

**L2 — Interactions.** Open every dropdown, toggle every switch, scroll to the bottom of every list. You get every option, every state.

**L3 — Real actions.** Execute actual tasks — place an order, complete a payment, submit a form, go through a full onboarding. You get hidden screens (confirmation, success, error, edge cases), actual fee/pricing behavior, and the gap between what the UI promises and what actually happens. This may cost real money or create real data.

## The route map

ROUTES.md is the single most important artifact. Everything else derives from it.

```markdown
# [App Name] Route Map

> Version: [x.x.x] | Explored: [date]
> Device: [model] | Method: ADB MCP
> Status: **Complete** (102 screenshots)

## Notes
- Biometric prompt blocks screenshot (FLAG_SECURE) — documented via UI dump
- Test account: user@example.com
- Device-specific: [any quirks]

## Routes

| # | File | Screen | Key Elements |
|---|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 001_lock_screen.png | Lock screen | Logo, fingerprint icon, "Unlock with Password" |
| 2 | 002_home.png | Home | Balance $241, 11-tile grid, 2 dApp cards |
| 3 | 003_search.png | Search | Search bar, filters, recent history, 3 categories |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Checklist
- [x] Lock & auth
- [x] Home
- [x] Swap + chain select + token select
- [ ] Settings → Custom Network
```

Every screenshot gets a row. Key Elements is factual — what you see, not what you think. The checklist is honest — unchecked items are known unknowns. This is valuable. It tells the next person (or the next session) exactly where to continue.

## Setup

You need a phone and an MCP server that lets the agent see and touch it.

**On the phone:** Developer Mode on, USB Debugging on. Connect via USB.

**On the computer:**

```bash
# Verify connection
adb devices

# MCP server — add to your agent's MCP config (.mcp.json)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:ForrestKim42/mobile-mcp#feat/llm-friendly-ui-analysis"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is a [patched fork](https://github.com/ForrestKim42/mobile-mcp/tree/feat/llm-friendly-ui-analysis) of [mobile-mcp](https://github.com/mobile-next/mobile-mcp). Supports **both iOS and Android** — real devices and simulators. No additional setup beyond the config above. Key features:

- **Single tool (`mobile_do`)** — reads screen, performs actions, and returns updated screen in one call. No separate list/tap/type tools to juggle.
- **Stable element IDs** — every element gets a `TYPE:Label` ID (e.g. `BUTTON:Confirm`, `INPUT:amount`). Duplicates auto-suffixed (`BUTTON:Confirm@2`). IDs are resolved at tap time via fresh UI dump, so keyboard/modal coordinate shifts are handled automatically.
- **Action batching** — pass an array of actions to execute in sequence: `["tap TEXT:Bridge", "wait 2000", "tap INPUT:0", "type 5", "wait 5000", "tap BUTTON:Confirm"]`. The response includes the final screen state.
- **React Native / Flutter support** — automatic fallback when standard UI dumping fails on animated apps. Bundled and auto-pushed to device on first use.
- **Keyboard auto-dismiss** — typing automatically closes the keyboard afterward so subsequent taps hit the right coordinates.
- **Bottom sheet dismiss** — `dismiss` action drags the sheet handle downward to close WebView-based bottom sheets that ignore BACK.

## Transition table

ROUTES.md tells you what's on each screen. A **transition table** tells you what happens when you act — `screen + action → next screen`. This is what makes fully batched, zero-dump flows possible.

```markdown
# TRANSITIONS.md

## Home
- tap TEXT:Bridge → Bridge
- tap TEXT:Swap → Swap
- tap TEXT:Settings → Settings

## Bridge
- tap INPUT:0 + type {amount} → Bridge (with quote)
- tap BUTTON:Confirm → BiometricPrompt
- tap BUTTON:Polygon → ChainSelector

## BiometricPrompt
- tap BUTTON:Cancel → PasswordSheet

## PasswordSheet
- tap INPUT:Unlabeled + type {password} + tap BUTTON:Confirm@2 → Bridge (tx submitted)
```

With this, an entire multi-screen flow can be pre-planned as a single batch — no intermediate UI dumps needed. The stable `TYPE:Label` IDs make this work: `BUTTON:Confirm` is always `BUTTON:Confirm` regardless of session or screen resolution.

Build it naturally during Phase 1 exploration. Every time `mobile_do` returns after an action, the response shows the new screen — that's a transition. Record it. After exploration, the transition table is complete and flows become fully deterministic.

## Tips and tricks

**Biometric / FLAG_SECURE screens** capture as black. The UI dump still works — it reads the accessibility tree regardless. Cancel the biometric prompt to reach the password fallback.

**Bottom sheets that won't close** — WebView-based bottom sheets may ignore BACK and backdrop taps. Use `dismiss` to drag the handle down. If no handle is found, it falls back to a swipe-down gesture.

**Session breaks** are inevitable — context limits, app crashes, device timeouts. ROUTES.md's checklist is your resume point. Read it, find the unchecked items, continue from the last screenshot number.

**Don't assume absence.** If you didn't tap it, you don't know if it exists. "Not found" and "doesn't exist" are different claims. The checklist enforces this — an unchecked item is an honest gap, not a negative finding.

**Real actions reveal hidden UX.** Confirmation flows, error states, pricing details, rate limiting, post-action screens — none of these appear until you actually execute. A single real action surfaces screens that UI exploration alone will never find.

## Why this works

The bottleneck in app research was never the analysis — it was the data collection. Tapping through an app is tedious, inconsistent, and incomplete. You get tired, you skip things, you forget what you already checked. An LLM agent doesn't get tired, maintains a checklist, and can tap through 100+ screens in a session without losing track.

The human's job is to direct: which app, how deep, what to focus on. The agent's job is everything mechanical: tap, capture, record, navigate back, repeat. The result is research-grade coverage that would take a human team days, produced in hours, with every claim backed by a screenshot.

## Note

This document is intentionally abstract. It describes a pattern, not an implementation. The exact file structure, the ROUTES.md format, the naming conventions, the depth level — all of that depends on your app, your goals, and your agent. The examples above are from real explorations (100+ screenshots each), but the pattern works on any app with a UI. Share this with your LLM agent and build out the specifics together. The document's only job is to communicate the idea. Your agent can figure out the rest.

## File structure

For reference, here's what a completed exploration looks like:

```
